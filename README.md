# ULD (URL List Downloader)

ULD is a simple Python app that downloads a list of URLs from a text file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following modules installed:

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): This module is used for making HTTP requests. It's commonly used for downloading files from URLs. Install it by running:
  
pip install requests

- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/): This module is used to create progress bars. It's not strictly necessary for the functionality of the code, but it provides a nice visual representation of the download progress. Install it by running:
  
pip install tqdm

## Usage

Once you have installed the required modules, you can run the app. Simply follow these steps:

1. Prepare a text file containing a list of URLs.
2. Run the ULD app.
3. Provide the path to the text file containing the URLs when prompted.
4. The app will download each URL from the list.

That's it! Enjoy using ULD!
