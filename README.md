# ULD (URL List Downloader)

ULD is a simple Python app that downloads a list of URLs from a text file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following modules installed:

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): This module is used for making HTTP requests. It's commonly used for downloading files from URLs. Install it by running:
  

```bash
pip install requests
```

- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/): This module is used to create progress bars. It's not strictly necessary for the functionality of the code, but it provides a nice visual representation of the download progress. Install it by running:
  
```bash
pip install tqdm
```  


## Usage

To use the ULD (URL List Downloader) app, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your URL List File**: Create a text file containing a list of URLs that you want to download.

2. **Navigate to the App Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the ULD app is located.

3. **Run the App**: Enter one of the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    python ULD.v0.1.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 ULD.v0.1.py
    ```

   Replace `ULD.v0.1.py` with the actual filename of the ULD app if it's different.

4. **Follow the Prompts**: The app will prompt you to provide the path to the text file containing your list of URLs.

5. **Sit Back and Relax**: The app will then proceed to download each URL from the list.

**That's it! Enjoy using ULD!**
